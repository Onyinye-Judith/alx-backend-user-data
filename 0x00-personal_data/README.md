PII is mainly applied in the US but lacks a single legal definition, while personal data has a legal meaning defined by the GDPR in the EU. Both types of data cover information that could directly or indirectly reveal an individualâ€™s identity.
PII can be divided into a few categories, the most common of which are linked (e.g. name, SSN) and linkable (e.g. job position, non-specific age) information. Other types of PII include sensitive and non-sensitive PII.
Personal data includes any information relating to an identified or identifiable person, including online identifiers like cookies and IP addresses.
Companies must take measures to protect PII and personal data. Legal requirements are getting stricter, requiring organizations to closely examine the data they collect and stay compliant with changing regulations.
